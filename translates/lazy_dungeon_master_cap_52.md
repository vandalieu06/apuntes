# LAZY DUNGEON MASTER CHAPTER 52

**PAG 1**

Last time...

The saintness performed a mysterious ritual that crippled our dungeon menu

And while there's a silver lining, my ability to create golems...

She unleashed upon me an even more devilish trap!

Damn... She's trying to seduce me...!

How shameful!

**PAG 2**

HO-HO, Are you shy? You don't need to be

Back Home we'll be kissing in front of all the people, so you'd better get used to it now...

Ugh...

Aah

Ki..Kissing

Stop right here! I'm the only one who gets to play with Khema like that!

**PAG 3**

Chapter 52: Three days of competition 

**PAG 4**

Rokuko?

Ho-Ho... Khema is that her?

I am!

I'am Khema's partner name's Rokuko!

He has me! An you're not wanted here!

Ho-ho, how cute

Well then, Ro-Ku-Ko, I shall marry you too call me "My Lady" 

**PAG 5**

Never ever! Neither me nor Khema!

We're gonna live here forever!

I'don't know why but she is so cool... I may be falling for Rukoko now.

That sounds stupid, but...

Is it the famous suspension bridge effect?

Well, i don't think so

Because the village will soon disappear

**PAG 6**

It will not! Don't decide things on your own!

I'm the most important person to Khema!

This ring is proof!

Ha-ha.. (revisar japones)

What a splending ring

Please, make one for me as well , Khema

Can't do

That is problematic...

Why should she have a better ring than I?

**PAG 7**

I know!.. Give me the ring!

That solves everything!

And i will make you a ring out of the dungeon core instead!

You are... my enemy!

Let's make a bet...!

**PAG 8**

You said you are gonna destry the dungeon in three days, right?

Do that and you can take my ring, whatever you want!

If you cant't, give up on Khema and leave us alone!

So be it 

And so teh saintess left the mayor's office saying she had to prepare

We will both die if the saintess conquers the dungeon, so will get nothing

I have to collect myself...

Cause i don't want to die

**PAG 9**

1st day of the competition (revisar en japones)

No new traps or rooms can be added during the effect of ritual magic [trinity]

Defeated monsters won't respawn either

Therefore is she can kill the "Black wolf" once in these three days, the conquer will be a breeze

Alka started gathering mana before entering the room

If she could only win with a one hit will at the beginning of teh battle...

But she didn't have a chance!..

**PAG 10**

She didn't stop chanting!

This was her only way defeat the beast

**PAG 11**

Had it swung vertically, she would have died!

It can't last for longer but...!

**PAG 12**

**PAG 13**

**PAG 14**

Chant completed

"The power of my love!!"

[JUDGEMENT...

...RAY]!!

**PAG 15**

**PAG 16**

It didn't hit Rin?!

Check it out

Okay!

He is alive, but just looks strange

It's like a donut

Hmm..?

Oh, we get DP from the saintess though

**PAG 17**

...

Hey, something on your mind? (revisar del japones)

This is the attack that he felt "needes" to avoid

There is a possibility that the saintess can kill Rin

I didn't know that she had such a backup plan..

Seems like it can't be used often and requires a lengthy chant

Just two more days...

Would my golems be enough as the last resort...? 

**PAG 18**

Masteeer!

I have Succeeeded! (revisar del japones)

O-Oh?!

Ho-Ho-Ho, let me ask you a qeustion!

Can someone improve golems with magic tools~?!

Don't know, but i would like to hear it from you

**PAG 19**

She tried many things until something worked

And that's all neurone who was only able to create shining magical tools at the start

She learned a thing or two from kantara about making magic circles properly

As a result of her work several prototypes were created

A sand golem which could make sand come out of its stomach

A water golem that could spray water from its knees

A fire golem that could make its face catch on fire

No-No-No... That's not what  I was asking you to build!

...

 Master, i have one more for you to seee!

Ha-a... Whatever, show me

Just look at it, it's wonderfuuul!

**PAG 20**

I made golem with hot water coming out of its eyes!

Isn't it amaaazing?! A technological breakthroooough!

Hm...? Wait a second

How did you get hot water? There isn't any "hot Water" magic

Right, master, this is the triiick!

**PAG 21**

I carved two magic circles instead of oneee!

When activating both the fire and water magic circles

I was able to create a golem that produces hot water

If only we could place trap in them instead, that would be so much beetter

Nerune... How many small magic circles can you make?!

The hald siiize? About ten per daaay

**PAG 22**

If 1/10th the size

We will make a hundred... No two hundred a day

But it's impooossible!

Beign so precise and making sooo many!

itÂ¡s possible...! And I have a good idea how

We are going to make a golem that would ve able to use magic to fend off saintess

I'll call it Project Gargoyle!
